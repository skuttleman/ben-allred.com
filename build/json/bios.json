      "I have always enjoyed writing code. I was introduced to the basics of coding when I was five years old. Throughout my life, other interests came and went, but I always found ways to incorporate coding into my other hobbies. However, my ability to write code had been self taught, and I knew I was never going to be able to transition to a career as a developer without schooling. For a long time, I equated that to four or more years of college which was time and money I couldn't afford. Then, I heard about \"coding bootcamps\".",
      "In the fall of 2015, I attended Galvanize's Full Stack Web Developer program, a bootcamp style learn-to-code course. I spent eight or more hours every day for six months coding browser-based applications, building web servers, interacting with databases, consuming third-party APIs, and learning about build tools and frameworks. If it wasn't for Galvanize, I wouldn't have had the opportunity to become a professional developer.",
      "In the spring of 2016, I began working for DISH as a web developer. I didn't expect to stop learning after Galvanize, but for some reason I thought the challenges and the rate of learning new things would settle to a more sustainable pace. I was wrong. At DISH, I have continued to grow as a developer which is exactly what I said I wanted when I started working there. Putting my life on hold for six months to go to coding bootcamp was a scary proposition. Will I succeed? Can I get a job? Will I enjoy this carreer change? Luckily for me, it was one of the best decisions I've made in my entire life, and I can't wait to see where my life takes me because of it."
